# Simulation and Fitting of FRAP Data in Python
master.py contains all of the code Erik Oas, my coresearcher, and I wrote. It is split into three primary sections. Section 1 is the code used to extract the necessary data from the microscope image files. Section 2 is the simulation code where the finite difference method is implemented. Section 3 is our fitting/test code, where we compare our simulation to our data. Note that this code was originally written in Google Colab, which is why this code has the slightly atypical section headers.

The included slides served as the visual aid for our presentation at the ACU Undergraduate Research, Creativity, and Innovation Festival.
