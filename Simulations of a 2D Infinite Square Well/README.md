# Simulations of a 2D Infinite Square Well
This code was my honors contract for my Quantum Mechanics course. It includes the 2d infinite square well simulation as the final section, along with alternative visualizations for 1D wave function simulations. This code was originally written in Google Colab, hence the section labels present in the code.
