# League of Legends Outcome Prediction
LoL_Tensorflow.py is the main code for this project. We ended up opting for a TensorFlow-based NN for our classifier. The data we used for training and testing came from the official Riot Games API. Classifier_Tester.py was used to test our other classifiers, such as random forest and gradient booster.
